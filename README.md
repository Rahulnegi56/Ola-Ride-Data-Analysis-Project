I worked on a data analysis project for Ola ride data on July 2024, using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization.

📊 Goal:
The objective was to uncover key insights about ride performance, booking trends, cancellations, payment behavior, and customer satisfaction during the month.

🔍 Key Highlights:
1. Analyzed over 1 lakh bookings with a total value of ₹35M.
2. Found that around 62% rides were successful, while the overall cancellation rate was 28%.

Among cancellations:
1. Drivers canceled mostly due to personal or vehicle issues (35.5%)
2. Customers canceled due to issues like driver not moving toward pickup or change of plans

💰 Revenue Insights:
1. UPI and cash were the dominant payment modes, together contributing the majority of the revenue.
2. Identified top 5 customers contributing significantly to booking value.

📈 Trend Analysis:
1. Built time-series charts for ride volume, distance per day, and booking value, spotting peaks during weekends.
2. Tracked driver and customer ratings, which remained stable around 4.00, indicating consistent service quality.

✅ Tools Used:
SQL: for data filtering, aggregation
Power BI: for interactive dashboards using DAX & Power Query.
